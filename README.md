# Image-Style-Transfer

In this project, our group explored an interesting application of image visualization in deep learning, image style transfer. 
According to a related paper published in 2016[1], we built the content and style representations based on a pre-trained VGG-19 model.
Then we defined the weighted loss, ran Adam optimization algorithm over the output image and compared results in different parameters. 
Finally, we applied our final model to different content and style images, resulting in some lovely stylish content images.

The goal of this project is to add a painting filter to a photo, which transfers the style of a painting to a photo. 
The main focus of our work is to turn the paperâ€™s methods into realization in Python, and at the same time, to test different parameters and compare their results. 
We also want to practice our deep learning skills and coding skills, especially in Tensorflow.
